# Simon_Game
I developed an interactive Simon Game using JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS to recreate the classic memory-based game. The game dynamically generates a sequence of colors using random number generation, and the user must recall and repeat the sequence. I implemented event handling for user clicks and key presses, using DOM manipulation to provide real-time updates to the game's interface. The game features visual button animations and sound effects for user interaction, enhancing the gameplay experience. Additionally, it includes logic for handling success and failure states, with a reset functionality to allow players to restart after an incorrect input.
